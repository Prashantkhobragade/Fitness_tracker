## Project Overview

The Fitness Tracker App is a Python-based project focusing on the implementation of machine learning to create a fitness tracker. The project's primary objective is to process and analyze sensor data for the classification of barbell exercises like Squat, Bench Press, OHP, Dead Lift, ROW, and the counting of repetitions.


## Features
  
* Sensor data collection and analysis
* Classification of barbell exercises
* Repetition counting algorithm
* Real-time exercise tracking


## Project Background

The project aims to address the limitations of existing fitness trackers which predominantly focus on cardio exercises, often neglecting strength training. 
By leveraging sensor data and machine learning, this app offers a solution to track and analyze strength training workouts effectively.

## Importance of Sensor Data

The app utilizes sensor data collected during gym workouts, specifically from the accelerometer and gyroscope attached to the wrist during barbell exercises. This data provides crucial insights into movements and repetitions during each exercise, enabling the creation of a custom algorithm for automated exercise tracking and repetition counting.


## Machine Learning Implementation

The project heavily involves applied machine learning techniques, employing the Pandas library for raw sensor data processing and modeling preparation. Various classifiers are explored to classify different barbell exercises based on sensor data. A custom algorithm for real-time repetition counting and exercise tracking is developed.
